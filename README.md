This is the final project for EE4321 HDL.

It is a simple 256-bit CPU that can handle Matrix Arithmetic, Integer Arithmetic, and Branching. It current is programmed to do a set list of tasks, but the tasks can be modified to do any arithmetic evaluation. The processor consists of 8 internal registers, but only the first 5 are useable for data storage. The Memory *currently* holds 14 different 256 bit data values, but this can be modified to be more data, same with the Instruction Memory.

A sample waveform is provided to demonstrate functionality, It is split into 6 different images Wave1-Wave6.
